5. a)	After replacing the reading and math scores, how is the district summary affected?
After replacing the reading and math scores I can see that the average and percentage passing for reading is higher than math.
    b)	After replacing the reading and math scores, how is the school summary affected?
The school summary would be affected because budgets will decrease as well as math scores will increase.
    c)	How does replacing the ninth grades’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance, relative to the other schools?
By replacing the ninth grades’ math and reading scores Thomas High School’s performance would not have been affected because it is constant.
